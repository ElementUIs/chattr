## Intro {#intro}

`chattr` is an interface to LLMs (Large Language Models). At this time, it integrates with OpenAI's GPT 3.5 and DaVinci models. In the future, `chattr` will be extended to support other LLM's. `chattr` enriches your request with additional context to improve the quality of the model's response. For more info, see the [How it works](#how-it-works) section.

`chattr`'s main goal is to aid in EDA tasks. The additional information appended to your request, provides a sort of "guard rails", so that the packages and techniques we usually recommend as best practice, are used in the model's responses.

## Install {#install}

Since this is a very early version of the package, you can either clone the repo, or install the package from GH:

```{r}
#| eval: false
remotes::install_github("edgararuiz/chattr")
```

## Getting Started with OpenAI ("ChatGPT") {#getting-started-with-openai-chatgpt}

### Secret key {#secret-key}

OpenAI requires a **secret key** to authenticate your user. It is required for any application non-OpenAI application, such as `chattr`, to have one in order to function. A key is a long alphanumeric sequence. The sequence is created in the OpenAI portal. To obtain your **secret key**, follow this link: [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

By default, `chattr` will look for the **secret key** inside the a Environment Variable called `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Other packages that integrate with OpenAI use the same variable name.

Use `Sys.setenv()` to set the variable. The downside of using this method is that the variable will only be available during the current R session:

``` r
Sys.setenv("OPENAI_API_KEY" = "####################")
```

A preferred method is to save the secret key to the `.Renviron` file. This way, there is no need to load the environment variable every time you start a new R session. The `.Renviron` file is available in your home directory. Here is an example of the entry:

```         
OPENAI_API_KEY=####################
```

### Test connection {#test-connection}

Use the `chattr_test()` function to confirm that your connection works:

``` r
chattr_test()
✔ Connection with OpenAI cofirmed
✔ Access to models confirmed
```

## Using {#using}

### The App {#the-app}

The main way to use `chattr` is through the Shiny Gadget app. By default, it runs inside the Viewer pane. The fastest way to activate the app is by calling it via the provided function:

```{r}
#| eval: false
chattr::chattr_app()
```

![Screenshot of the Sniny gadget app in a dark mode RStudio theme](man/figures/readme/chat1.png)

A lot of effort was put in to make the app's appearance as close as possible to the IDE. This way it feels more integrated with your work space. This includes switching the color scheme based on the current RStudio theme being light, or dark.

Automatically, the app will automatically add buttons to each code section. The buttons lets us copy the code to the clipboard, or to send it to the document. If you ["call"](#keyboard-shortcut) the app from a Quarto document, the app will envelop the code inside a chunk.

### Keyboard Shortcut {#keyboard-shortcut}

The best way to access `chattr`'s app is by setting up a keyboard shortcut for it. This package includes an RStudio Addin that gives us direct access to the app, which in turn, allows a **keyboard shortcut** to be assigned to the addin. The name of the addin is: "Open Chat". If you are not familiar with how to assign a keyboard shortcut to the adding see the Appendix section: [How to setup the keyboard shortcut](#how-to-setup-the-keyboard-shortcut).

## How it works {#how-it-works}

![Diagram that illustrates how chattr handles model requests](man/figures/readme/chattr-diagram.png)

`chattr` enriches your request with additional instructions, name and structure of data frames currently in your environment, the path for the data files in your working directory. If supported by the model, `chattr` will include the current chat history.

To see what `chattr` will send to the model, set the `preview` argument to `TRUE`:

```{r}
library(chattr)

data(mtcars)
data(iris)

chattr(preview = TRUE)
```

### How to setup the keyboard shortcut {#how-to-setup-the-keyboard-shortcut}

-   Select *Tools* in the top menu, and then select *Modify Keyboard Shortcuts*

    ![Screenshot that shows where to find the option to modify the keyboard shortcuts](man/figures/readme/keyboard-shortcuts.png){width="700"}

-   Search for the `chattr` adding by writing "open chat", in the search box

    ![Screenshot that shows where to input the addin search](man/figures/readme/addin-find.png){width="500"}

-   To select a key combination for your shortcut, click on the Shortcut box and then type *press* the key combination in your keyboard. In my case, I chose *Ctrl+Shift+C*
