This is the output of a linear regression model where the dependent variable is
mpg (miles per gallon) and the independent variables are all other variables in
the mtcars dataset. The coefficients represent the estimated effect of each
independent variable on the dependent variable, holding all other variables
constant.

The intercept (12.30337) represents the expected value of mpg when all other
independent variables are equal to zero.

The p-values associated with each coefficient indicate the level of statistical
significance of the estimated effect. A p-value less than 0.05 is typically
considered statistically significant.

The multiple R-squared (0.869) indicates the proportion of variance in the
dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables in the
model. The adjusted R-squared (0.8066) takes into account the number of
independent variables in the model.

The F-statistic (13.93) tests the overall significance of the model, and the
associated p-value (3.793e-07) indicates that the model is statistically
significant.

The residuals represent the difference between the actual values of the
dependent variable and the predicted values from the model. The residual
standard error (2.65) is a measure of the variability of the residuals.
