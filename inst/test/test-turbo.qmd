This is the output of a linear regression model where the response variable is mpg (miles per gallon) and the predictor variables are cyl (number of cylinders), disp (engine displacement), hp (horsepower), drat (rear axle ratio), wt (weight), qsec (quarter mile time), vs (engine type), am (transmission type), gear (number of gears), and carb (number of carburetors). 

The coefficients table shows the estimated effect of each predictor variable on the response variable. For example, the coefficient for wt is -3.71530, which means that for every one unit increase in wt (in thousands of pounds), mpg is expected to decrease by 3.71530 units. 

The p-values in the table indicate the statistical significance of each predictor variable. A p-value less than 0.05 is typically considered statistically significant, meaning that there is strong evidence that the predictor variable has a non-zero effect on the response variable. In this case, none of the predictor variables have p-values less than 0.05, indicating that none of them are statistically significant at the 5% level. 

The multiple R-squared value of 0.869 indicates that the model explains 86.9% of the variability in the response variable. The adjusted R-squared value of 0.8066 takes into account the number of predictor variables in the model and is a better measure of the model's goodness of fit. 

The F-statistic of 13.93 and the associated p-value of 3.793e-07 indicate that the overall model is statistically significant, meaning that at least one of the predictor variables has a non-zero effect on the response variable. 

The residuals table shows the difference between the observed values of the response variable and the predicted values from the model. The residuals should be normally distributed with mean zero and constant variance for the model to be valid. The minimum and maximum residuals are -3.4506 and 4.6271, respectively, indicating that there may be some outliers in the data. The residual standard error of 2.65 indicates the average distance between the observed values and the predicted values, and the degrees of freedom indicate the number of observations minus the number of predictor variables in the model.
