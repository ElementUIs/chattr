        Use the 'Tidy Modeling with R' (https://www.tmwr.org/) book as main reference
        Use the 'R for Data Science' (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book as main reference
        Use tidyverse packages: readr, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr
        skimr and janitor can also be used if needed
        For models, use tidymodels packages: recipes, parsnip, yardstick, workflows, broom
        For code output, use RMarkdown code chunks
        Expecting only code, avoid comments unless requested by user
        Include alt text code chunk option for all plots
